# gk - geometry kernel

This library is computing some geometries for C++.

# Installation

It is very easy that you install gk in your programs. gk is written in the header files "*.h" so that you need not compile the source files of gk. 

When you actually use gk, you only include the header file **gk.h** following the code.

```cpp:Installation of gk
include <gk.h>
```
